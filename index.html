        <p class="blog-post-meta">2024</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Many wrongs will come my way, in fourscore years and ten.<br>
          Some natural, and who can blame? The rest from fellowmen.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">But just who are my enemies? In truth, there's only one.<br>
          Not fellow man, but fallen wraith—though once was fellow son.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Behind each wrong received from man there lurks a flaxen cord.<br>
          But look behind their eyes as well, you’ll see our blessed Lord.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">You’ve intruded, in a way, on private tutoring<br>
          Two masters teaching them to yield, one devil and one King.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">You’ve observed their lost control through your own mote-filled eyes.<br>
          So hold your tongue, forgive and love. And don’t think yourself wise.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Others do the same for you when you are weak and mean.<br>
          Contention is the devil’s sport. And judgment for the King.</p>

        <h2 id="2024" class="blog-post-title">Sometimes I Am</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">2024</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Sometimes I am a leper. Things falling all apart.<br> An outcast and a lost cause. A sickness in my heart.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Sometimes I am a blind man. I just can’t see ahead.<br> No hope of sight, just darkness. Reaching as I tread.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Sometimes I am a lamed man. No movement in my feet.<br> I’m stagnant while the others walk up and down the street.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Sometimes I am a deaf man. I cannot hear a sound.<br> I cannot hear the music. Just silence all around.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Sometimes I am a dumb mute. My mouth won’t make the words.<br> So much inside but what comes out are incoherent slurs.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Sometimes I am possessed and seized. The influences legion.<br> I hurt myself and those around, immune to pleading reason.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Sometimes I am a dead man. Dead to what is right.<br> That side of me now in a tomb, wrapped and out of sight.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Sometimes I am a storm inside. Emotions tempest-tossed.<br> Buried in the waves and winds, fearing all is lost.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Sometimes I am in prison. A slave to metal bars.<br> My hopes and dreams all shackled down. Surrounded by cruel guards.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Sometimes I am “an hungred”. My soul not satisfied.<br> One of the five thousand guests, hoping to abide.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Sometimes I am a withered hand. A tight and anxious mess.<br> A twisted, gnarled, useless thing unfit to reach and bless.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Sometimes I am a bloody mess. My “issue” always near.<br> Disruptive and embarrassing. A life of constant fear.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Sometimes I am run out of wine. Consumed as fast as poured.<br> My best, I offer to the fray, who still complain for more.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Sometimes I am a fisherman, whose nets are bare again.<br> With empty pockets, heading home, a failure among men.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Sometimes I am encircled by those with stones to throw.<br> My faults and weakness widely known, I wait for the first blow.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Sometimes I am a publican. A traitor to my kin.<br> Ashamed, but not uncomfortable, in lavishness of sin.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Sometimes I am attacked by one whose calling is to lead.<br> My ear cleaved off when I refuse to hear his new decree.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">But I have made a covenant, so…</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Other times a hand shoots out, to cover wounded ear.<br> To still the sword, and heal the rift. Restore a way to hear.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Other times I heed His call, I come and follow Him.<br> Disciple now, not publican. My wealth now peace within.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Other times He comes to protect me from the stones.<br> Forgives my faults, rebukes my foes, until we are alone.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Other times my catch of fish is more than nets can hold.<br> My meager efforts multiplied, a fortune when they’re sold.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Other times my wine is the hero of the feast.<br> So much! The best they’ve ever had! Praise I deserve the least.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Other times my reach of faith makes whole the very thing,<br> That bled me dry so many years, my hidden suffering.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Other times my withered clench releases—stretches out.<br> And I can be His hand again—lift others out of doubt.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Other times I feast upon the fishes and the loaves.<br> My spirit fills with warm content, so grateful that I chose.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Other times His servant comes to open prison’s door.<br> That’s it! Nothing fancy. A chance to try once more.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Other times, a peaceful still replaces fearful sea.<br> The storm rebuked by Architect, who times things perfectly.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Other times I’m raised to life, by my friend, my Lord.<br> Loved ones help peel back my bonds, I leave my tomb once more.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Other times His voice breaks through, and banishes my demons.<br> Fit for swine, but not His son—an end to this dark season.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Other times His healing finger rests upon my tongue,<br> To loose the words inside of me—speak joy to old and young.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Other times the melodies of life ring in my ears.<br> A mountain wind, a crashing wave, the laugh of someone dear.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Other times my legs are strong, I stand, I walk, I run.<br> On His errand. On His path. An agent of the Son.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">Other times my sight is clear. My vision far and wide.<br> He shows the things I ask to see—the truth not His to hide.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">And other times, my leprous rot and solitude are mended.<br> And I return to thank the Carpenter—now King ascended.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">These things all happened long ago, for people who believed.<br> But they can also happen for more Latter souls like me.<br> A cov’nant is a lifeline, allows me to repent.<br> To change and try again is what “repent” has always meant.</p>

        <h2 id="2024" class="blog-post-title">Filthy Water</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">2024</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Myopic man looked out from his standing place of stone, <br>
        and left the rod to plunge into the river and the foam.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">It excited him to make a splash, to tread amidst the churn, <br>
        to live a life of speed and change, to bend around each turn.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Currents carried him along, down least resistant paths.<br>
        Never climbing, always new, and best of all—was fast.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">At times he’d climb the foreign shores, with thought to check the rod. <br>
        But bare, exposed, and shivering, he’d dive back to his cause.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Eventually he passed away, away from steady land. <br>
        And even then, each island showed ex-swimmers, rod in hand.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">But not for him, he’d grown accustomed to this swirling fray. <br>
        The uphill walk held no appeal, that simple narrow way.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Until that fateful day when he reached the lowest place. <br>
        The stagnant pool where currents, waves, and rapids stop their race.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">With land far gone, and water calm, he now saw all the filth. <br>
        The rank, abhorrent, stinking pool—the kingdom he had built.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">He sank down, and filthy water burned inside his chest. <br>
        Stains within and stains without, no ground on which to rest.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">He’s still there, though eons passed, still drowning in the pool. <br>
        What’s left for him to do but curse the times he’d been a fool?</p>

        <p class="pt-2">He’d tasted living waters, he’d feasted at the tree. <br>
        He’d seen the darkness yield and his spirit had been free.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">And then he’d left it all behind, he’d double-crossed his homage. <br>
        He’d sold it for a shorter ride, a rotten mess of pottage.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">He’d spurned the holy hand and wrist, the call to stand on water, <br>
        To leave his filthy prison and progress toward the Father.</p>

        <h2 id="2023" class="blog-post-title">A Sphere For You</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">2023</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Child, I’ve created a sphere for you,<br>
        Of earth and air, water and plants. <br>
        You will spend a short time on that sphere to learn how to progress here.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Each moment there you will spend within a second sphere, <br>
        This is one that you will create—not of water and stone, <br>
        But of influence. </p>

        <p class="pt-2">I will give you innocence in youth so that you expand your sphere freely. <br>
        New friends, new interests, new skills, new dreams. <br>
        You’ll make room for them all.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">But as you grow, you will become more cautious with your sphere. <br>
        After all, expanding it is an uncomfortable, messy, and confusing process <br>
        (It’s just that the young don’t mind so much).</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Things are clear to the young. Life has a way of fogging up meanings. <br>
        So, as you grow I will give you duty. A role, a family, a call. <br>
        With one hand you’ll wipe away the fog, and with the other you’ll perform your duties. <br>
        Duties force you to expand your sphere—even if not as quickly as before.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">But I won’t always show such a heavy hand. After all, it is your sphere! <br>
        You’ll need to learn to let duty fade back into love. A love of expanding your sphere. <br>
        To lean into difficulties. To welcome all. To seek opportunities. <br>
        To be still on the inside and engaged on the outside.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">If you do, then you’ll find peace in the discomfort, meaning in the mess, and confidence in the confusion.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">If you don’t, then a celestial life is not for you. <br>
        An exalted life is one of expansion and growth, universes and families, responsibilities and glory.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">A comfortable life is what awaits the terrestrial and telestial. <br>
        Their spheres will be rigid, stagnant, hollow, and comfortable.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">So go child, enter my sphere and begin your own.</p>

        <p class="blog-post-meta">2022</p>

        <p class="pt-2">We sit in our favorite place. She lets me play with her hair. Her flowing physical hair. <br>
        “Will my hair be like that?“ <br>
        The thought is almost as familiar as the setting.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">I look into her perfect eyes, windows to her proven spirit. That spirit glows within her skin and her bones. <br>
        I feel Her love and confidence. <br>
        “Could my spirit ever be so strong and true and kind and good?”<br>
        The thought is almost as familiar as the sight.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Her voice is solid and clear, gentle and mighty.<br>
        “Your name will be Eve.”<br>
        The first mother of all who will live in our new world? Me? </p>

        <p class="pt-2">I’ve heard the plan many times. Mortality. Veil. Justice. Proving. Savior. Change. Growth. <br>
        Poor Lucifer, he couldn’t see. He will be my devil.<br>
        Oh Jehovah, just like Father. He will be my King.<br>
        And noble Michael. He will be my Adam.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">“Tell me again about you and Father in mortality?”<br>
        Those stories, her perfect recollection. Her children there. Her worries and sorrow. Her patience and joy.<br>
        How they lived in faith together. Inherited glory together. Built a kingdom together.<br>
        So familiar to me now.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Her counsel before it is my time to go:<br>
        “My daughter, wisdom and courage have long been your gifts. You will see and act. Your actions will exalt us all, together.”</p>

        <p class="pt-2">I am ready.</p>

        <p class="blog-post-meta">2022</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Leave the garden? But the fruit is always ripe, the nights always warm, the animals all kind.<br>
        And yet, something is missing. Isn’t life more than just comfort?<br>
        Change must come before growth.<br>
        “Is there no other way?”<br>
        No. I knew it then and I know it now.<br>
        “This is the way, walk ye in it.”</p>

        <p class="pt-2">A coat? Of skins? A knife? Blood? Gore? But those beasts have always been our dear friends.<br>
        And yet, these coats are a gift from Father. Hasn’t He always worn coverings?<br>
        Change must come before growth.<br>
        “Is there no other way?”<br>
        No. I knew it then and I know it now.<br>
        “This is the way, walk ye in it.”</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Alone in this world with Lucifer? But he is a devil now and filled with damning vengeance.<br>
        And yet, Mother and Father and Jehovah are not really gone. Isn’t presence deeper than sight?<br>
        Change must come before growth.<br>
        “Is there no other way?”<br>
        No. I knew it then and I know it now.<br>
        “This is the way, walk ye in it.”</p>

        <p class="pt-2">An altar? Of stone? But the rocks cut my hands and the weight is too much.<br>
        And yet, don’t we want to speak with Father? Surrender, then hear His voice?<br>
        Change must come before growth.<br>
        “Is there no other way?”<br>
        No. I knew it then and I know it now.<br>
        “This is the way, walk ye in it.”</p>

        <p class="pt-2">A field? A plow? Sweat? Blisters? But this grain isn’t sweet, and this work is so slow.<br>
        And yet, the fruit trees are now bare. And our bellies cry for food.<br>
        Change must come before growth.<br>
        “Is there no other way?”<br>
        No. I knew it then and I know it now.<br>
        “This is the way, walk ye in it.”</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Argument? Hurt? Frustration? But we never acted this way before—is this really “meet”?<br>
        And yet, later we apologize and love each other more deeply than before.<br>
        Change must come before growth.<br>
        “Is there no other way?”<br>
        No. I knew it then and I know it now.<br>
        “This is the way, walk ye in it.”</p>

        <p class="pt-2">It’s time for the child to come? Out of where? Why do I hurt so badly? But I’m not ready, and the cost is so much.<br>
        And yet, Mother of All Living. Sweet Cain now here—smiling in my arms.<br>
        Change must come before growth.<br>
        “Is there no other way?”<br>
        No. I knew it then and I know it now.<br>
        “This is the way, walk ye in it.”</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Seth hungry again? Abel wants to be held? Cain can’t play by himself? But it all falls on me to provide.<br>
        And yet, Mother of All Living. Adam is busy as well—missing us while he works.<br>
        Change must come before growth.<br>
        “Is there no other way?”<br>
        No. I knew it then and I know it now.<br>
        “This is the way, walk ye in it.”</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Division? Death? Wickedness? But these are my posterity, and I am their mother.<br>
        And yet, there is also much good. Much that is bitter and much that is sweet.<br>
        Change must come before growth.<br>
        “Is there no other way?”<br>
        No. I knew it then and I know it now.<br>
        “This is the way, walk ye in it.”</p>

        <p class="pt-2">White hair? Weathered skin? A new spirit world to organize? But we’ve worked so hard in this place—our loved ones are all here.<br>
        And yet, I am strong. I am capable. I am not alone. There is a plan.<br>
        Change must come before growth.<br>
        “Is there no other way?”<br>
        No. I knew it then and I know it now.<br>
        “This is the way, walk ye in it.”</p>

        <h2 id="2021" class="blog-post-title">A Tabernacle in the Wilderness</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">2021</p>

        <p class="pt-2">In wilderness long we each wandered<br>
        Alone and away from past life<br>
        With goal to find land full of promise<br>
        Far back from the edge of the knife</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Those first days were marked by His presence<br>
        Breaking chains and parting the sea<br>
        Sending food from above when entreated<br>
        And water from rock when was cleaved</p>

        <p class="pt-2">But time began passing more slowly <br>
        That Promised Land so out of reach <br>
        Just sand and a stagnant tomorrow <br>
        Alone in the desert heat</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Then day when we found one another<br>
        Two friends that soon became more<br>
        A decision to make tabernacle<br>
        A whole where just halves were before</p>

        <p class="pt-2">My fabric of previous living<br>
        The cloth of who you had been<br>
        We brought all we had to that sealing<br>
        The cov’nant of stitching begin</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Though never in life is completed <br>
        This tent we are trying to make<br>
        Is room for Him, Holy of Holies<br>
        And refuge from Eden’s dark snake</p>

        <p class="pt-2">The work done within, sacrificial<br>
        To give, and through giving, receive.<br>
        Our grisly mess sprinkled on altar<br>
        An imperfect cry of belief</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Our Lord is aware of our journey<br>
        No hewn stone requireth He<br>
        Just sticks and a soft linen cov’ring<br>
        To go where He listeth us be</p>

        <p class="pt-2">While holy it is in its nature<br>
        Inconvenient it is, by design<br>
        And the pitching and knitting and cleaning?<br>
        A taste of the work of divine</p>

        <p class="pt-2">The heavens protect our creation<br>
        A cloud from the day’s harshest sun<br>
        Or fire’s bright light, as a crown in the night<br>
        All darkness around is undone</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Someday, we will enter our Canaan<br>
        And two perfect beings become<br>
        Where dusty and worn tabernacle<br>
        Is given a glorious home</p>

        <p class="pt-2">But joy is not locked in a soil<br>
        The reward of a journey’s end<br>
        That love is embroidered in canvas<br>
        That we take the time to mend</p>

        <p class="blog-post-meta">2020</p>

        <p class="pt-2">A fellow did a wrong today and I was there to see.<br>
        The consequences rippled out, all dark and oily.<br>
        An unsolicited addition to my hurried walk,<br>
        Upon my arm there fell a black and stinking little drop.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Anger boiled up inside, I spun to make it known, <br>
        That justice would be taken now, no mercy would be shown.<br>
        And there we stood, while back and forth the insults and the ire, <br>
        We tossed about and wallowed in, like hogs within their mire.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">We coated selves in rotten slop, befitting of our kind. <br>
        We had ignored the little thoughts that first had come to mind:<br>
        <i>It’s just a little drop on me, why not just wipe away, <br>
        From body and from thought and mind, and go enjoy the day?</i></p>

        <p class="pt-2">Instead we squealed till voice grew hoarse, then tromped in separate ways. <br>
        Our only alm to fellow men, some mud prints and some gray.</p>

        <p class="blog-post-meta">2020</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Sweet Callie Kitty, was naturally pretty,<br>
        And new in the schoolyard that day<br>
        With long golden hair, and beautiful stare,<br>
        She sought out the others to play</p>

        <p class="pt-2">She gasped as they came, and her cheeks turned to flame<br>
        She stifled the shock in her face<br>
        Their pink whiskered scalps were as bald as the alps <br>
        Their left eyes had rocks in their place</p>

        <p class="pt-2">One of the litter, with eye rock a’glitter<br>
        And voice like a bird on the run,<br>
        Said, “I love your dress, love that brand, it’s the best!”<br>
        And blah blah and "Hey girl!" and "Hun!"</p>

        <p class="pt-2">This went on, of course, these canned compliments forced<br>
        Until Callie finally said,<br>
        With voice in a whine, “and you too look divine!”<br>
        “I love what you’ve done to your head!”</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Like steam from a valve, a sigh rose from the crowd,<br>
        Relieved to have been justified.<br>
        Not many days hence, and she too lost all sense<br>
        To follow the pipe of the pied.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Poor Callie Kitty, eye hole slightly gritty<br>
        But all of her ducks in a row<br>
        To flatter next guest till they too join the rest<br>
        Be Ponzi in sad puppet show.</p>

        <p class="blog-post-meta">2020</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Just who exactly are you<br>
        ‘Neath quillage of the world?<br>
        When inner vessel is laid bare<br>
        What record there is told?</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Whose wages chime your pocket?<br>
        How thick your flaxen cord?<br>
        Is strait or strange the road you’re on?<br>
        From darkness? Or toward?</p>

        <p class="pt-2">When looking in your own eyes,<br>
        How quick to look away?<br>
        When night has come and you lie still<br>
        How proud of the passed day?</p>

        <p class="pt-2">For we are like the craftsman<br>
        Whose hours are, with tools,<br>
        Engraved upon his masterpiece<br>
        According to this rule:</p>

        <p class="pt-2"><i>Each stroke, both true and blunder<br>
        Upon the ingot wrought<br>
        Will change, in e’en the smallest part,<br>
        The value of the lot</i></p>

        <p class="pt-2">Value, after all, is why<br>
        we chose this mortal time<br>
        To work a plow and sweat a brow<br>
        And hidden knowledge find</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Not wealth, with fame and comfort,<br>
        For those things hold no worth<br>
        Behind the gilded sleeping Baal<br>
        Is only simple earth</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Which some day may just mark you<br>
        Too late you’ll cast aside<br>
        Your idols to the moles and bats<br>
        With which you’ll wish to hide</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Accept this plain reminder<br>
        Which warps if not in use<br>
        Improve the shining moment now<br>
        Avoid the rooftop’s noose</p>

        <p class="pt-2">A lifetime to make perfect<br>
        Or close as you can come<br>
        A tribute to your Father’s plan<br>
        A gift made for His Son</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Include two open handles<br>
        To lift to holier sphere<br>
        And latticework of honesty<br>
        And pounding out of fear</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Carve plain accreditation<br>
        To hands that guided you<br>
        And ciphered-in acknowledgment<br>
        For tutelage granted few</p>

        <p class="pt-2">May your marks in the metal,<br>
        Be wisdom and be love,<br>
        May your life’s work reflect and shine<br>
        A smile from above.</p>

        <h2 id="2019" class="blog-post-title">Two Serpents and the Man Between</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">2019</p>

          <p class="pt-2">His folly damned him long before<br>
          That fiery dying day;<br>
          Rebellion had sunk to his core<br>
          The devil’s bitter wage.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">His neck of iron obstinance<br>
          His brow of moulded brass.<br>
          Akin, yet full of difference,<br>
          To what he would let pass.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">So when the serpents cornered him<br>
          He did not feel surprise<br>
          He opened himself up to them<br>
          And welcomed all their guise.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">Exhilarating fire was<br>
          What washed throughout his frame.<br>
          His ears becoming deafened to<br>
          The clarions of pain.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">Hurriedly he gathered others<br>
          Of his poisoned plight<br>
          To bolster his delusion that<br>
          They would end up all right.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">Some came to join his reveling <br>
          Some came warning to not.<br>
          But rather look upon some thing<br>
          To heal their so-called rot.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">They said a brazen serpent had been<br>
          Placed upon a staff.<br>
          A symbol of both life and health,<br>
          Now raised on their behalf.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">An idle curiosity<br>
          Until the fateful name<br>
          Of Moses, was the source announced,<br>
          From whence the promise came.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">“From Moses?” cried they, “The old fool!”<br>
          “Of course we should have guessed!<br>
          The self-proclaimed deliverer<br>
          Who started this vain quest.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">“Away from homes and precious things<br>
          To find some promised land,<br>
          While only place not sand out here<br>
          Is ruled by giant man.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">“We should have known he’d want to come<br>
          And take away our fun,<br>
          And guilt us into following<br>
          His rules and to him run.”</p>

          <p class="pt-2">Refusing to give up on them,<br>
          The messengers began<br>
          Extending hands, repeating back<br>
          The plainness of the plan.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">“All that you need to do is look—<br>
          Immediately you’ll find<br>
          A healing balm begin to soothe<br>
          The fire in your mind.”</p>

          <p class="pt-2">“What’s this?” cried out our ‘tagonist<br>
          “You’ve bite marks of your own!”<br>
          And to the others pointed out<br>
          Their fading scars with scorn.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">“You see?” he said triumphantly<br>
          “They’re no better than you, <br>
          Why cower to their frenzied call<br>
          Which they claim to be true?</p>

          <p class="pt-2">“The living draft from yonder snakes<br>
          Still flows in their veins too.<br>
          Yet in denial they proclaim<br>
          And tempt you to their rouse.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">“All are bitten, yet we are not<br>
          Suffering in pain.<br>
          But looking at some lifeless sham<br>
          Will chain you up again.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">“This venom is a milder sort,<br>
          It won’t have long effect.<br>
          And how could looking change a thing?<br>
          Why join you to their sect?</p>

          <p class="pt-2">“If you decide to turn and look<br>
          What does that say of you?<br>
          No better than a common ass,<br>
          A mindless sheep or two!”</p>

          <p class="pt-2">With that he looked up with a snort<br>
          To hear what they would say.<br>
          The others too, who were not quite <br>
          So sure which was the way.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">With brow that was now furrowed from<br>
          This callow twisted speech,<br>
          And tear of pity welling up<br>
          To run across his cheek,</p>

          <p class="pt-2">A messenger, with head held high,<br>
          Said, “Brother, that’s not true.<br>
          We once believed as you do now, <br>
          That same obstructed view.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">“But hearken when I tell you that <br>
          When it’s no longer new,<br>
          This poison that you venerate<br>
          Will be the death of you.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">“You’ve seen my scars and yet your master<br>
          Whispers you his lies.<br>
          And hides a truth so subtly<br>
          That you don’t realize.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">“My wounds have healed since those dark days<br>
          When they were stark and fresh.<br>
          But I’ve been there, that hole you’re in,<br>
          Where conscience finds no rest.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">“So trust me when I say to you,<br>
          The things you feel will change.<br>
          What’s new and pleasing to you now<br>
          Will turn to blistering pain.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">“Your limbs will lose ability,<br>
          To take you from this place.<br>
          The ‘leventh hour pass away,<br>
          An endless night to face.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">“You’ll try in vain to twist about<br>
          That stiffened neck of iron,<br>
          But liquid justice hold you there,<br>
          Your soul and body burn.”</p>

          <p class="pt-2">Then with a kind inviting smile<br>
          He turned to face the rest,<br>
          “I did not know for sure that day,<br>
          I had just hope at best.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">“But I let that hope work in me<br>
          To swell within my breast<br>
          And gradually it dawned on me,<br>
          The lie Satan had dressed:</p>

          <p class="pt-2">“I had been bitten by a snake!<br>
          I had a dire need<br>
          Of healing—now! Immediate!—<br>
          A Savior with to plead.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">“So up I went and though first steps<br>
          Were awkward in display<br>
          Discomfort too, but pressing on,<br>
          The tense unease gave way.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">“The nagging jeer within my mind,<br>
          ‘How can one look change you?’<br>
          Seemed less important, as my walk<br>
          Brought new things into view.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">“I saw a host of bitten Saints,<br>
          Some staggering, some not,<br>
          Each helping fellow victims of<br>
          This world’s relentless slaught.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">“The eyes of all the people there<br>
          Were fixed with joy and love,<br>
          With faces shining, hearts aglow,<br>
          On what was fixed above.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">“And then I saw it glittering,<br>
          A figure on a cross,<br>
          The brazen symbol of rebirth,<br>
          A promise for this dross.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">“My trauma had begun to heal<br>
          The moment I resolved<br>
          To stand upon my own two feet <br>
          For my bite, seek absolve.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">“But now, eyes fixed upon the staff,<br>
          I felt a sudden change,<br>
          The fire in me was replaced<br>
          With fire all the same.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">“Not wicked, burning, lusting for<br>
          Some natural carnal thing,<br>
          But burning holy gratitude,<br>
          A longing for my King.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">“My life now has a noble cause<br>
          A purpose far beyond<br>
          The gathering of comforts which<br>
          In time will all be gone.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">“So if you want to find renew<br>
          Your life and fate to save<br>
          We’ve come back to this haunted place<br>
          To help you find the way.”</p>

          <p class="pt-2">With that each of those poisoned few<br>
          With groan and pain arose<br>
          And followed out the messengers<br>
          To leave their deadly foes.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">All but the one, who still could not<br>
          Accept the cutting truth<br>
          Who’d rather stay and wallow in<br>
          His pride and sin uncouth.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">Two serpents and the man between<br>
          The choice he failed to make<br>
          He chose the lesser of the two<br>
          The dark and slith’ring fake.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">While outside stands the gleaming source<br>
          Of hope in fallen world<br>
          The shining beacon risen up<br>
          The banner now unfurled.</p>

        <p class="blog-post-meta">2019</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Important thoughts, rich with meaning<br>
        Subtle beyond words<br>
        Of worlds and purpose, choices, time <br>
        Tragedy and scope.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Each a sacred fleeting promise<br>
        Of a noble truth<br>
        A prize to claim, to seize upon<br>
        Whispered by a God.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">The challenge then, the mighty quest<br>
        Itself a subtle thing<br>
        To capture, to give shape and form<br>
        To put in words the thing.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">To do this, or to even try<br>
        Before the practiced hand<br>
        Of Satan lifts it gently ‘way<br>

        Of empty hollow things<br>
        So flashy, funny, popular<br>
        A barb of muted sting</p>

        <p class="pt-2">A shadow, cold and pitiful<br>
        The fruit of fallen man<br>
        Designed to banish and replace<br>
        What holy might have been.</p>

        <p class="blog-post-meta">2019</p>

        <p class="pt-2">The temple is a holy place— <br>
        Brings us close to heaven <br>
        Like Adam’s altar long ago, <br>
        After they left Eden. </p>

        <p class="pt-2">The temple is a vital place <br>
        Where we should often go, <br>
        Like Israel’s camp who had to use <br>
        A tent to make it so. </p>

        <p class="pt-2">The temple is a royal place, <br>
        The house of our great King <br>
        Like one from time of Solomon <br>
        Filled with the richest things. </p>

        <p class="pt-2">The temple is a special place <br>
        Which means so much to me, <br>
        Like one where Jesus taught and cleansed <br>
        And learned to make us free.</p>

        <h2 id="2019" class="blog-post-title">Mercy of Christ</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">2019</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Mercy, that unseen power of love,<br>
        Pris’ner of the law but part thereof<br>
        Her hands restrained, feet bidden to stay<br>
        Wrapped in chains of justice, the needful way<br>
        Waiting for deliv’rance, the rightful way.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Jesus, not yet with power to save—<br>
        Law required first He free that slave.<br>
        So, from the garden and the cross won<br>
        Key to loose her shackles, bid her come.<br>
        Mercy, the companion of the Son.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Now stands a Savior, power to heal.<br>
        Hands, with perfect scars and grace to wield.<br>
        And we are left with freedom to choose<br>
        The prodigal’s husk or widow’s cruse<br>
        To share mercy’s balm, His gift to use.</p>

        <p class="blog-post-meta">2019</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Meek the lamb of common pasture,<br>
        Trusting and relying on<br>
        Ram and ewe and gentle master,<br>
        Proud to be their little one.<br>
        At their call, content to follow,<br>
        Meek the lamb who can revere.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">As a Boy in old Judea,<br>
        Learning of His lot to be.<br>
        As a Man, by Jew and Roman,<br>
        Called to bleed upon the tree.<br>
        Trusting, drank the cup as given<br>
        Now a Savior, always near.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Voice of darkness, growing louder,<br>
        Clamoring for us to hear.<br>
        But the still voice of our Master<br>
        Leads us to a knowledge clear.<br>
        Simple faith will always triumph<br>
        Over darkness, over fear.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Plain, the choice left to be answered,<br>
        Open gate to narrow path.<br>
        Just as Moses’ brazen standard,<br>
        Start of “all the Father hath.”<br>
        Meekness, that most bless’d surrender,<br>
        Meek the Lamb who loves us dear.</p>

        <p class="blog-post-meta">2019</p>

        <p class="pt-2">The day, which for them, seemed so distant at first,<br>
        When birth, and a Savior, end Israel’s search<br>
        Now coming with haste while they must plod along,<br>
        With only a donkey’s rough bray for their song.<br>
        And tearful hosannas are sung evermore<br>
        For that journey to welcome the Heavenly Lord.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">A call from the Father, an errand of joy,<br>
        A part in the veil to go herald the Boy.<br>
        For He who had stood with them, Almighty King,<br>
        Is now a poor Babe, so they gladly take wing.<br>
        And tearful hosannas are sung evermore<br>
        For that journey to welcome the Heavenly Lord.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">That star which rewarded three lifetimes of wait,<br>
        Now guiding the men with their wise kingly gait<br>
        Who, scripture and prophecy searching had found,<br>
        The sign of their Master, their gifts to help crown.<br>
        And tearful hosannas are sung evermore<br>
        For that journey to welcome the Heavenly Lord.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">The life of abandon, of sin and of pain,<br>
        Or life where not known is the God who was slain<br>
        Is saved by the power of mercy and love<br>
        With the choice to follow our Brother above.<br>
        And tearful hosannas are sung evermore<br>
        For that journey to welcome the Heavenly Lord.</p>

        <i>"In memory of our God, our religion, and freedom, and our peace, our wives, and our children." - Moroni</i>

        <p class="pt-2">In memory of my family, that all too soon will be. <br>
          Of parents dear who've led the way, and love me perfectly.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Of future calls, to serve our King, I must be ready for.<br>
          Of people many, if I'm true, with blessings laid in store.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Of work to do, right here and now, of which I must be part.<br>
          Of promptings from the Holy Ghost I must have in my heart.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Of things to do, for all that's true, of which I'll never know,<br>
          If I shrug off the gentle push of He who helps me grow.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Now you know and you believe in whose name's over your heart<br>
          So courage take and let Him help you rise to play your part!</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Remember, if the burden seems to be too much to bear<br>
          Or even if it seems, for now, it always will be there</p>

        <p class="pt-2">That once you sat in Tampa, and things did seem that way<br>
          But deep within your heart you heard your spirit boldly say,</p>

        <p class="pt-2">"I'm a chosen son of God, and He has led the way.<br>
          I was not meant for failure here, I believe,</p>

        <p class="pt-2">So Come What May!"</p>
